There are two XSL files for converting Content MathML to Presentation MathML: ctop.xsl and ctopff.xsl. The difference between the two is that ctopff.xsl uses a modified namespace and mode usage. Those differences are apparently necessary if we want to use the XSL file with Firefox (hence the file name!) and, as it happens, they are also necessary for use with Qt. This is therefore the version we use here. However, the Presentation MathML it generates is not exactly what we want, so we edited the file quite a bit.
